Hint for maxiGos (developer section)

How to change of version
------------------------
1) Update the version number
    Update $v value in _maxigos/_php/version.php (evenly update _maxigos/_doc/license.txt)
    Update mxG.V value in _maxigos/_js/mgos_lib.js (mxG.V="n.nn";)
    Update maxiGos version in first commented line of any modified files
2) Make and upload the new build
    Make stand-alone players using _maxigos/_php/aloneMaker.php
    Make plugin zip files (copy _maxigos in plugin folders, then zip them and evenly rename them)
    Make a zip of _maxigos and give it a name like "_maxigosnnn.zip"
    Upload _maxigos, _maxigosnnn.zip and plugin zip files

BOM or no BOM
-------------
Save files with no BOM

HTML5
-----
Add to the top of any html files:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

Charset
-------
Add <meta charset="UTF-8"> (or any <meta> that set a charset such as Big5, GB18030, Shift_JIS, ...)
Remember that the server may overwrite this information (check header sent by the server using curl)
Be sure that sgf is actually encoded in the charset specified in its sgf CA property
When using a maxiGos player in a page which is not in UTF-8, don't forget to add
charset="UTF-8" as attribute of the script tag that loads the code of the player

Responsive design
-----------------
Add <meta name="viewport" ...> in the head part of html files
For instance:
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0,user-scalable=yes"> 
Evenly add @media queries in css files
Evenly use maxiGos fitParent parameter

Center comment when "single line" and justify comment when "multiple lines"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A) first method
div.mxCommentContentDiv {display:table;margin:0 auto;text-align:justify;}
B) second method
div.mxCommentDiv {text-align:center;}
div.mxCommentContentDiv {display:inline-block;text-align:justify;}

Canvas availability test
------------------------
In mxG.CanCn, better to test toDataURL (some browsers support getContext but not toDataURL)
since maxiGos uses toDataURL

Using data base64 image
-----------------------
Take care that base64 data url may contain //
Careless function for removing comment will corrupt such data
Evenly, replace // by %2f%2f before removing automatically comments in scripts

Stand-alone player and external resources
-----------------------------------------
Remember that stand-alone player will not retrieve external resources (img, js, php, ...)
if the player is downloaded alone, or moved in a folder which is not the folder where it was built.
Remember that some samples may use img in their css that are not base64 encoded

Big $POST data may not upload
-----------------------------
If big $POST are not upload (for instance, if after a form submit, some $POST['xxx'] remain empty),
on can put the data in several $POST variables (the size-max can be as low as 1 MB per value 
on some servers, especially when suhosin is used)

Button styles
-------------
Remember that width of a button includes its borders by default
To remove outline from button on focus (firefox):
button::-moz-focus-inner {border:0;padding:0;}
To make button size on focus the same as in other browsers (firefox):
button::-moz-focus-inner {padding:0;}
To remove outline from button on focus (chrome):
button {outline:0;}
For accessibility reason, if one removes theses outlines, replace it by something else.
Easier to style button div than button itself since button display is highly browser dependant.
To hide maxiGos default navigation button content (i.e text such as "|<", "<<", "<", ...):
button div span {display:none;}
If the navigation button content is not hidden, some ugly outlines may be displayed by google.
If flex is used on navigation bar with flex-wrap, use flex:1 0 2em instead of flex:1;
otherwise safari (at least up to v9) bugs.
To avoid bug with simplified chinese fonts
(some simplified chinese chars are too hight, thus buttons have not all the same size),
give a line-height (for instance 1.25em) to buttons or button divs
or give a font-family such as arial to buttons
Border-radius: let it without value, cms may change it but it is nice in many cases

(otherwise some simplified chinese chars are too hight and thus buttons may have different heights).
Set margin, padding, border, color, background (even to 0 or none)
to try to avoid upset when using maxiGos in a cms

Android ghost canvas bug
------------------------
Sometimes, Android (at least some 4.x versions on samsung) displays a ghost canvas of the goban 
on the top left of the screen.
Try to suppress any css overflow:hidden or overflow-x:hidden on any maxiGos contener parents.

Goban shadow bug
----------------
At least safari 6.1 and various safari on iOS hides goban shadow if this shadow is set for 
div.mxGobanDiv canvas. Instead use div.mxInnerGobanDiv to set shadow around the goban.

White/light text on black/dark background bug
---------------------------------------------
At least safari 6 and 7, dirty background under text on goban canvas (not reproductible each time).
To counter it, you can add:
.mxGobanCanvas {-webkit-font-smoothing:antialiased;}
But the drawback is that white/light text on black/dark background bug are less readable.

for ... in ... bug
------------------
Avoid use "for (x in y)" which cannot work properly with CMS like joomla.
For instance, joomla 2.5 adds his own properties to some (any?) associative arrays.

language code with a "-"
------------------------
Using the "." operator, a javascript property name cannot contains a "-" .
Thus, use "_" instead of "-" in parameter names in php configuration file.
Sample:
	in php
	$gosParam["optionLabel_zh_tw"]="O";
	becomes in javascript
	mxG.D[mxG.K].optionLabel_zh_tw="O";

Comment component
-----------------
Set line-height to try to avoid upset when using maxiGos in a cms (?)

Navigation component
--------------------
If fitParent&2, font-size will be recalculate. So use px or rem for margin unit to be sure
to have the same distance to the goban for all configuration of the same theme.

Tree component
--------------
TreeDiv must be big enough to contain at least one node,
otherwise possibly bad scroll position at the beginning (when only one node?)

Keyboard navigation and div with scrollbars
-------------------------------------------
When a div has scrollbars, it cannot be focused using tab key on chrome and ie (september 2016),
but all is OK on firefox. There are bug reports for chrome and ie on that subject.
Thus add tabindex=0 on mxCommentDiv and mxTreeDiv when the browser is not firefox.
Note that tabindex=0 allows the div to take the focus even if it has no scrollbars,
and it is not what one want (i didn't find a simple workarround for that).
This is the reason why one doesn't add tabindex=0
when the browser is firefox, since things are working well in this case.

focus
-----
A user can force the focus mark to appear setting the convenient option in his browser
01/09/2016: if the active element is disabled, one can continue to navigate on modern browsers
using tab key. Focus automatically go to element parent if this parent can get the focus.
"Navigation" component:
It seems one need to use focus() on "NavigationDiv" if the button becomes disabled
to be able to navigate "immediately" using arrow keys (case of the navigation bar),
The disabled button is still the active element (it has the focus mark)
but it can lost the focus (on firefox and chrome but not on safari?)
"Solve" component:
Tab, shift tab, enter keys and space are all what one need when using keyboard navigation.
Seems no need to use focus() on "SolveDiv" since one doesn't use keyboard arrows to navigate here.

table
-----
To use display:table to shorten element width, inner elements must be block or equivalent, 
not inline or inline-block

fitParent and scrollbar
-----------------------
When fitParent is 1, possible resize loop when scrollbar appears/disappears
thus compute size of the window as if it has scrollbars even if actually it is not the case.
Warning: mxG.verticalScrollBarWidth() gives a different result when browser zoom

display:table
-------------
Take care when using display:table, numerous possible css side effects.
For instance with phpBB3, subsilver2 style, a "padding" is added to all tables
Note: .mxInnerGobanDiv was display:table until maxiGos v6.39

rfg.js on joomla
----------------
Images of toolbar don't display on Mac firefox 29.0.1. 
Force a scroll to make them displayed.
Note (2016/09/20): Edit is no longer in the rfg sample

Edit component
--------------
Both drawEditTools() and setStoneTool() need a setTimeout (the second runs after drawEditTools())

Multi-column break-inside
-------------------------
{display:inline-block;} arround the player avoids break inside in case of multi-column (?)

float clear
-----------
When using float clear, don't forget to have a surrounding element that sets a new format context
(i.e. has a css such as overflow:auto;), otherwise unwanted result can occur

Large inline-block
------------------
Set an explicit width to inline-block that contains potentially large content
otherwise it can expand and doesn't stay on one line in the flow

fitParent and goban canvas font-size
------------------------------------
When fitParent=1, don't set goban canvas font-size to the new value,
otherwise browser zooming will stop to work

html tags in sgf
----------------
In theory, a sgf record doesn't contain html tags,
and even if a such tag is found, it should be displayed as any other text, not as html tag.
To get this result, maxiGos replaces < and > by &lt; and &gt;
before displaying a text found in the sgf record on the screen.
Unfortunately, framework editors often add some html tags
(for instance <br> or <p> tags when the user inserts a line break in a text).
As a result, sgf records inserted "as is" by the user are polluted by these tags.
So in such a case, maxiGos replaces any <br> tag by a line break
(i.e. instead of rewritting <br> in &lt;br&gt;, it lets it as is),
even in the rare case where it was originally in the sgf record
(no way to determine if the <br> was inserted by a framework editor or by the user).
Do a similar procedure with <p> and </p> tags
(remove <p> and replace </p> by <br><br> when the sgf record is inserted as is by the user).

Forum sample
------------
Buttons: z-index:1 otherwise may be not clickable when in phpBB3 (under NavigationDiv)

Iroha sample
------------
don't confuse "卄" (U+5344, the good one) and "〹" (U+3039, which doesn't work on android, ios, chrome windows, ...)
don't confuse "卅" (U+5345, the good one) and "三" (U+303A, which doesn't work on android, ios, chrome windows, ...)
Bug firefox(?): with iroha, if one uses paper.jpg as background both for "Quit" button and maxiGos buttons
firefox doesn't end loading the page about half of the time (and thus the goban is not displayed). 
Workarround: suppress "paper.jpg" as button background. 

Tatami sample
-------------
Comment padding left and right: no em, 12px=goban parent padding when no bowl (8px)
+ navigation buttons margin (2px) and shadow or border (2px)

Others (some may be out-of-date, take care)
-------------------------------------------

Dowload attribute
// save doesn't work on ie11 (nothing done),
// half works on safari (download attribute not usable, but no crash)
// save may not work if long url are not allowed (need to verify this point)
save=function(f,s)
{
	var z=document.createElement('a');
	z.setAttribute('href','data:text/plain;charset=utf-8,'+encodeURIComponent(s));
	if (typeof z.download!="undefined") z.setAttribute('download',f);
	else z.setAttribute('target','_blank');
	document.body.appendChild(z);
	z.click();
	document.body.removeChild(z);
};

Firefox may freeze when one change a css maxiGos file and then reload the page 
(happened sometimes on forum sample)

Don't use mouseMove, mouseDown and mouseUp events on Android when select goban area (buggy)

To make CommentDiv and TreeDiv not larger than goban:
- parent: display:table;
- .mxCommentDiv {position:relative;overflow:auto;height:9px;} /* set height otherwise no height since content is position:absolute */
- .mxTreeDiv {overflow:auto;height:9px;} /* TreeDiv is already position:relative */
- .mxCommentContentDiv {position:absolute;padding:0.5em;} /* padding better here othewise no space on right border */
- /* TreeDiv content is already absolute */

justify-content:center; bug on ie (result not centered) if buttons have a max-width.
Safer to give a width to navigationDiv then just use flex to stretch buttons in order to reach navigationDiv edges.
